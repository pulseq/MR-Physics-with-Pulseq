# MR-Physics-With-Pulseq
Materials for the Ph.D. Training program of the German Chapter of the ISMRM and beyond.

In this course, basic and advanced concepts of MR physics are introduced through theoretical lectures by MR experts and followed by the corresponding hands-on exercises. 

## Necessary technical preparation steps
Provided hands-on exercises and pulse sequence code snippets are in Python programming language. The hands-on exercises will be based on running Python code in Notebooks within Google Colab, therefore, no additional software is required.

## Organisation of this repository
This repository contains all course materials including hands-on exercises as Python notebooks and necessary raw data to run these notebooks and slides of the presentations. The latter will be uploaded after the course.
| directory | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| slides    | this directory will contain slides of all presentations in the PDF format, sorted by day/time (will be populated during or shortly after the event) |
| tutorials | contains subdirectories for topical exercises and code examples, sorted by the presentation order, along with the required MRI raw and/or simulated data | 
| .../.../notebooks | (subdirectory under exercises) place for interactive Python notebooks |
| .../.../data | (optional subdirectory under exercises) where appropriate, MRI raw data or simulated data to support provided notebooks |
| utils     | this subdirectory contains Python code repeatedly used in several exercises throughtout the course |
